# Outcome Prediction in Football Analytics

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of football plays, leveraging data from the 2023 season. By analyzing various features such as down, distance, field position, and play types, we aim to provide insights that can help football teams enhance their strategies and performance. This analysis utilizes datasets from Catapult and PFF Ultimate, incorporating advanced metrics and play-by-play data to understand the factors that lead to touchdowns, punts, or interceptions.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes the following primary data sources:

**Catapult:**
Provides athlete monitoring technology that offers insights into player movements and health.

**PFF Ultimate:**
Offers comprehensive football play-by-play data, including player grades and situational statistics.

## Feature Selection

The feature selection process was guided by discussions with subject matter experts from the university football team, including coaches and the analytics team. The chosen features are crucial in predicting the outcomes of football plays:

Down
Distance
Field Position
Formation
Gain
Run Concept
Run/Pass
Pass Result
The Play
These features were selected based on their relevance to the game's context and their impact on the play's outcome.

Navigate to the respective notebook for detailed steps and analysis.

## Model Performance and Evaluation
The predictive models, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were rigorously evaluated to ensure robustness and reliability. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

**Stratified Splitting:**
Both models were constructed using stratified splitting to maintain uniformity across training, testing, validation, and hold-out datasets. This method ensures that each set is a representative subset of the overall dataset, eliminating biases towards specific outcomes.

**Hold-out Dataset Testing:** 
Performance was also verified against a hold-out dataset, providing a clear insight into how the models perform on completely unseen data.

**Accuracy Measurements:** 
The models' accuracies were documented across various stages: training, testing, validation, and hold-out phases. The Gradient Boosting Machine model, in particular, showcased superior performance, demonstrating higher accuracy compared to the LSTM model.

**Feature Importance:** 
Analysis revealed that factors such as the play's immediate prior outcome, play number, gain, down, formation, and field position significantly influence model predictions. This indicates the models' capacity to discern and utilize intricate patterns within the data.

**Performance Metrics for Team Analysis:** 
Insights into team performance were also derived, such as average gain per play (4.9 yards) and pass completion rate (76.28%). Additionally, analyses like quarterback performance and formation personnel effectiveness were conducted to guide coaching strategies.

**Interface for Coaching Staff:** 
The insights and metrics have been made accessible through a user-friendly interface, allowing coaching staff to tailor strategies based on real-time data and analytics.

## Findings and Strategic Insights
The analysis has yielded pivotal insights into play outcomes and team performance, which can be leveraged to refine game strategies:

**Gradient Boosting vs. LSTM:** 
The Gradient Boosting Machine model outperformed LSTM, highlighting its efficacy in predicting football play outcomes. This suggests a preference for GBM in similar future analytical tasks.

**Critical Features:** 
Important features like play sequence, player formation, and field position have been identified as key determinants in predicting play outcomes. Understanding these elements can significantly impact play-calling decisions.

**Team Performance Metrics:** 
Detailed metrics such as average yards gained, pass completion rates, and player-specific analyses provide a granular view of team performance, enabling targeted improvements.

**Customizable Analysis for Coaches:** 
The development of a streamlined, interactive tool enables coaches to access and interpret complex analytics, fostering informed decision-making and strategic planning.

By integrating these models and insights into your strategy, there is a significant opportunity to enhance both individual and team performance, leading to more successful play outcomes and overall game strategies.
